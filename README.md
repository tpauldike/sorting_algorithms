# Sorting Algorithms
This was a team project done in `C programming` as part of the requirment in the **ALX SWE** program, and the whole aim was to understand and implement `sorting algorithms` of different types.
And, of course, to be able to evaluate or determine the big O notations of the time complexity of each sort algorithm:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

In this project, we also learned how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
